* ***Two buttons in the Guess game that was used to call to guess up and down.
examples of realality- for example a chair the propertes of a chair would be its colours and size whereas the functions would 
be the chair moving up or down and back and forwards.***

INT=numbers
Argument= provinding information to the function
Let = opposite of Variable
Variable = opposite of Let


Give an example (with an explanation) of how you write a function with one argument.

   ``` func addfunction(firstNumber: Int, secondNumber:Int){
      print(firstNumber + secondNumber)
    }
    ```
Show how you would "call" this function.
  
  ```addfunction(firstNumber: 7, secondNumber: 10){
  }
  ```

Give an example (with an explanation) of how you write a function with multiple arguments of different types.

```func printGreeting(name: String) {
	print("Hello, my name is \(name)")		
}
```

```printGreeting(name: "Tim")
printGreeting(name: "Yazz")
printGreeting(name: "Layla")
```
